            Tadasana, or mountain pose, is a standing yoga pose. It is the first position used in surya namaskar or sun salutations. It is also a starting position for your yoga practice.

            <h1>WHEN TO PERFORM TADASANA</h1>
            <img src="images/tada1.jpg">
            <p>While Tadasana is part of general <i>yoga practice</i>, it is noteworthy as the starting pose and final pose in most, if not all, <i>Surya Namaskar</i> sequences. As well as being used to start and finish sun salutations, Tadasana is one of the foundational <i>Ashtanga yoga poses</i> suitable for working on basic body awareness and control for other standing poses. Together with control and body awareness, it improves overall posture.</p>
